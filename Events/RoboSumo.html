        <p>At the heart of sumo bot competitions lies the fusion of mechanical design and programming prowess. Teams must meticulously construct their robots, optimizing their weight distribution, traction, and pushing power. They must also develop sophisticated control algorithms, enabling their robots to navigate the arena, anticipate their opponents' movements, and execute precise pushing maneuvers. The challenge objective is to force the opposing robot out of the arena by pushing or maneuvering them over the edge. Two bots compete in a head-to-head match following the basic system of traditional human sumo matches. Bots are allowed no weapons, and are not allowed to flip each other. The sole purpose is a pushing match between the two bots to force the other from the arena. </p>

            <p>Sumo bot competitions are a thrilling fusion of engineering, strategy, and athleticism. Participants craft small, autonomous robots programmed to push opponents out of a ring, emulating the ancient sport of sumo wrestling. Builders meticulously design their creations for maximum traction, weight distribution, and pushing power. Each match unfolds with rapid-fire manoeuvres, as robots jostle for dominance within the ring's confines. Strategies range from brute force to cunning evasion tactics, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats. Spectators marvel at the ingenuity and precision of these miniature gladiators, making sumo bot competitions a riveting showcase of technological innovation and competitive spirit.</p>

                The team must build and bring one pre-constructed, wireless robot whose purpose is to push, throw, flip, hit, drag or otherwise move the opponent out of the battle ring within the maximum battle time. The following section details the rules and specifications regarding the bot.

            <br>
            <b>Bot Shape & Weight</b>
            <br>
            <p>
                A Sumo Bot must fit within a square box of 30cm X 30cm with unlimited height. Bot may expand in size after a match begins, but must not physically separate into pieces, and must remain a single centralized bot. Bots violating these restrictions shall lose the match. Screws, nuts, and other robot parts with a total mass of less than 5 grams falling off from a robot's body shall not cause the loss of match.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Maximum weight should not be more than <b>5Kgs</b> (including battery for wirelessly controlled bots. However, a tolerance of 5% is acceptable.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Batteries must be sealed
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any robotics parts/builder material can be used until the bot meets the above specification.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bot should not contain any harmfull weapons that damage the opponent bot.
